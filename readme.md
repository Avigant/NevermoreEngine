## About
Nevermore is a ModuleScript loader for Roblox, and loads modules by name. Nevermore is designed to make code more portable. Nevermore comes with a variety of utility libraries. These libraries are used on both the client and server and are useful for a variety of things. 

Nevermore follows both functional and OOP programming paradigms. However, many modules return classes, and may require more advance Lua knowledge to use.
